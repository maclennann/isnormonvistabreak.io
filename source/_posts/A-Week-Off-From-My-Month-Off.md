I had a nice week off from my month off. Not much to report.

Did some cleaning and some laundry and reminded myself that the world isn't a train. It was tough because I lived on a train for 5 days. But then I watched [Snowpiercer](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1706620/) and suddenly the whole idea seemed absurd. Problem solved.

I hung up [an art](https://www.etsy.com/listing/245781992/earth-print-geometric-print-nordic?ref=shop_home_active_5) in my living room, so it's like I actually live here now. Looks alright.

Did some autumn hiking and some coding-for-fun. I missed coding-for-fun. Sometimes coding-for-work happens to be fun, but even in those cases it is still different from coding-for-fun.

This week also contained my birthday, which was nice. Dinner with my parents on Friday and met up with a friend for drinks on Saturday.

Everything took a turn for the worse on Saturday night/Sunday morning when I found that [Red Dwarf is no longer on Netflix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs7VQhVvxA). It caused physical pain as the core tenants of my beliefs were shaken and my world came tumbling down.

What will they take from me next, *Airplane!*?

### THEY WHAT?!

It's time to swear off the Internet and digital distribution...altogether.
