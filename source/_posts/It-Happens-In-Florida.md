So I went to Florida for a while for a wedding. Specifically my sister's wedding.

It was during the Food and Wine festival at Epcot, so there was plenty of fooding. Not a lot of wining, but lots of other-kinds-of-alcoholing.

We got in on Tuesday and hit up Epcot. Had a cousin doing a scuba dive there. I didn't know that was a thing, but it was pretty neat. Also Margaritas. And we ordered Churros only to find that a Churro - at least at the Cantina - is no longer a Churro at all, but like a handful of little pretzel-looking things. It was incredibly disappointing. Though I hear the carts around the other parks still have classic Churros. I wasn't able to verify.

Wednesday we did Epcot again, since we had a full day. Then we hit up Morimoto Asia for dinner and had some very good generically-asian food.

Thursday was the rehearsal dinner and other wedding-preparation activities.

Friday was the actual wedding. It started with me having to buy a ticket to Epcot in order to get to the hotel at which my parents and sister were staying because I got on the wrong bus.

After way-too-many pictures was the actual ceremony. It put me in mind of nothing so much as a Craigslist car deal. Like, the groom is standing at the end of the aisle, the father of the bride walks the bride down the aisle like, "here's the title, keys are on the driver's seat, she's all yours." But it was alright, I guess.

Then the reception, which was. Well, it was open bar. So it was a good time. Good to be able to catch up with family members.

Saturday, it turned out a couple of my friends were down for the weekend, so I met up with them. Well, first I had to walk through Epcot in dress shoes and jeans to get to my parents' hotel where my sneakers and shorts were. Anyway, it turns out my friends know how to do Disney, so it was nice. They knew where they were going and how to navigate crowds, so there was no stopping in the middle of walkways every 300 feet.

Then I managed to make it back to Boston despite my hatred of airports. I could have just as easily taken the train for a couple days.
