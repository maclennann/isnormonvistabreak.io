This used to say something really clever, but I guess I forgot to save. So when my battery died, so did my sweet-ass intro.

I wrote said intro around the time I made a joke on Facebook about asking people "where do you get off?" while on a train and hwo those may be misconstrued as fighting words, but I think the intro was something different.

Anyway, I've been on a train for five days. Well, not the same train. And not for 5 days straight. But it has been a long road back from Portland in any case. Only 6 more hours to go, then I'm back in Boston. Then I've got errands to run before I can even take the two hour drive back to my fucking house.

I hope my home is still standing when I get there. I'm also pretty certain a package got delivered and it's probably ruined from the rain. And my mailbox must be overflowing. I didn't realize how long two weeks was when I undertook this. Ah, well.

### Where do you get off?

So when I was booking my travel to Portland for Hashiconf/Vistabreak, I though to myself, "wait, I don't have to be back at work or anything the next week." So I was thinking of what I could do. Stay in Portland, go to Seattle or something. I ended up deciding to take the damn train back to Boston.

I got on a train in Portland on Monday afternoon, and here it is early Saturday morning and I'm finally in the home stretch.

### So, how'd it go

I was going to do a breakdown by leg of the journey, but honestly they were all more or less the same. I boarded the train, found my room (or took a seat), hung out for a while, went to the dining car, made some smalltalk over some salmon or chicken, went back to my room, did a shitload of reading due to lack of cell service, took a nap. Got off the train, identified the layout and customs of the station, grabbed some stale Pop-Tarts from a vending machine, loitered for 4 or 5 hours, and did it all over again.

### That sucks

Does it? I dunno. I mean, I'm not in a rush to do it again any time soon, but it's been a good experience. I think if I hadn't had sleeper cars for 3/4 of the trip I'd agree, but I've had plenty of space to just hang out and repeatedly tell attendants that I know how to operate the beds.

Especially after that week in Portland, it was nice to ~~netflix and~~ chill. I mean, I enjoyed my time in Portland, but that was a lot of sustained human contact and interaction. It was nice to have some time to myself.

### Well, almost to myself

So these are the kinds of people you meet in Amtrak cafe/dining cars:

* People (groups or couples) in their 70s or 80s.
    * They may be going to Reno, or they may just be out for a cruise. But they're always happy to tell you about how they took this same trip 30 years ago and this is like a third honeymoon.
* Train Supremacists
    * "Trains are just a much more civilized mode of transportation than flying."
    * "Oh, I never fly if I can help it. It's trains or driving for me."
* Railroad workers (or retired railroad workers)
    * "So if you see an engine made by anyone but GE, they all have the same gear ratios. The GEs may as well, but I can't say for sure."
    * "Yeah, they put concrete ties in a little while back for the freight trains, so we're going to have a much smoother ride coming up."
* Assorted travellers
    * "I just spent a couple of weeks camping out in Yosemite, now I'm on my way back to San Francisco to visit my friend, then I'm meeting my parents and we're driving to...."
* Me
    * "Yeah, I had some time to kill so I figured fuck it I'll take the train."

### So...would you do it again?

Ehhhhhhhyeah? Maybe.

I mean, it was cool. But I think maybe I'd make it a two week thing where I take breaks along the way. Like, if I could have stopped in Denver and/or Chicago for a day or two and hung out things would have been much more monotonous.

I'd also bring more stuff to do. Cell signal was worse than I was expecting. Except in the flat states where a single tower can broadcast as far as you please. But, like, Colorado? Ain't no signal down in those canyons. I read 3 books on this trip. That's not counting on the flight out and in Portland (where I read 1 book). Just on the train.

If I had a choice other than:

```ruby
do_internet if internet_exist?
do_reading
```

Though I haven't the faintest idea what such another activity could be.

Perhaps I've finally come to understand this human compulsion for companionship. It seems most logical in this case.

### Pics or it didn't happen.

Yeah, I'll throw up some pictures sooner or later. But, honestly, so many of them are just "green stuff through a dirty window" that what does it really matter?
