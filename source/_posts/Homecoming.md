That feel when driving for the first time in two weeks:

So I got to the Route128 Amtrak station at about 730am this morning and my parents were kind enough to pick me up. Then hung out, got a haircut, ate lunch, took a nap. And finally, around 4pm, it was time to drive home.

Driving for the first time after an extended break is always funny. I've never not driven for two weeks before, though. I mean, after I started driving. Heck I've never had two weeks of vacation before that I can remember.

So driving at all was one thing, but especially driving home was an interesting experience.

It was like...deja vu. Or like sleepwalking. I don't really know how to explain it. If I were a better writer I could probably to it justice.

It was different from other times when I was just on vacation and not driving for a period of time.

Specifically, I think it had to do with being on the train for so long. Being alone in those sleeper rooms for 5 days with limited Internet access kind of shrunk the scope of my world to just that room. Or, at worst, just that length of train cars between my room and the dining car. Everything else fell out of immediate memory. There was nothing much else going on in my head.

Driving home, even after recovering my driving abilities, was a strange sensation. Like I said above, it was kind of like sleepwalking. It was a drive I had made hundreds of times. Certainly I knew where I was going, and I had a lot of muscle memory about it, but it was like I had never actually driven that route before. It was a little bit of Twilight Zone shit, you know?

And then I got home. And certainly it was familiar and comfortable and all that. But again, for a little while it felt like somewhere I had only been in a dream, or a long time ago. Much longer than two weeks.

But anyway, I'm home now. So I'm gonna relax for a week or so before I need to head out again.
