#### Next week starts my 6 weeks off.

So that's cool. I mean, it's not completely unheard of - especially in the tech space. But it's unheard of for me to have more than a week with nothing to do. At least for the past 10 years or so. So I'm pretty excited.

#### Not really nothing.

"Nothing" to do might be a strong word. I've got a lot to do.

#### Anyway.

I wanted to try out [hexo](http://hexo.io) for a blog engine, so I figured I'd try it here and pretend I'm going to write about what's going on during my vistabreak, especially during my 5 day train trip across the country.

I'm not sure if that's going to happen, but this is a good evaluation of hexo. I kind of want to migrate my actual blog to this away from ghost. I tried other static site generators like jekyll before, but I didn't care for them. But this is nice. Maybe I just know how to computer better these days.
