Ugh. Single-digit number of days until I am meant to return to work. 6 weeks gone. Just like that.

I guess it's probably for the best. I'm starting to run out of things to do. I did crazy things like laundry and cleaning my house. Nah, who am I kidding? I'm not ready to go back to work.

But, really, not much went on this week. Like I said, cleaning and laundry.

Then on Friday I accidentally made a stir fry made mostly out of beef and hot sauce. It's not bad, but the ratios were way off. It was such an uneventful week that that qualifies as major news.

On Saturday was typical weekend activies of hiking and boardgaming with a friend. Also it was Halloween, so lots of candy and awful horror movies.

Now it's November. I almost referenced that instead of the Cake song for the title, but I guess I can stand to just embed a Youtube video of it.

Anyway. I guess I'd better make the most out of this last week.
