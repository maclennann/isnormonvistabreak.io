I'm writing this on a train leaving Sacramento. I actually left Portland yesterday. I miss it.

One day, I was walking down the street. There was this kid in his early 20s in a park. If he wasn't homeless, he was certainly on the verge thereof. He had a guitar and said, "Hey man, I'll play you a song for a dollar."

I'd seen him playing around town pretty much every day previously. He played that folk punk that I love so well. Made me wish I had a dollar, but I didn't. I told him, "Sorry, man." And he told me, "Don't be sorry; be silly."

That's Portland.

### Sunday

So I flew in on Sunday. Jeremy and Calvin flew in on Saturday, but as we all know parts of the world that I'm not consciously observing cease to exist, so that might as well have not happened.

We did usual 'first day in Portland' stuff. We hit up The Grotto for a quick jaunt. That was something I hadn't done before, so that was cool. It's so close to the airport that it usually doesn't make sense to do, but it was a nice enough place.

We did Kenny and Zuke's for lunch, as is tradition for me. Calvin accidentally got an insane sandwich. We visited the tree museum and learned that Calvin is a better firefighter than Jeremy.

We tried for the zoo, but it was too late, so we walked around a bit before heading back downtown.

Then we Masu'd for dinner. Calvin got a giant miso ramen. I ordered steak, but they had run out, so they went to Whole Foods just for me. I'm also pretty sure it was free? But I was vaguely sakied up so I could be misremembering.

Then we headed to the park to check out the eclipse, which was neat. A bunch of other folks were also hanging out for the same reason.

Then we hit up Deschute's on the way back to the hotel. Which is good because by that point I was worried I wasn't going to get drunk at all that night. Calvin learned that he doesn't like West Coast beer.

I also think we may have gotten ice cream at Ruby Scoops somewhere in there. I think after the eclipse. Everyone got ice cream sandwiches except for Jeremy.

### Monday

First day of Hashiconf! I'm not really going to talk much about Hashiconf-proper because that's all [over here](http://iwritethe.codes/hashiconf-2015-or-wheres-ryan-breen/) on my actual blog. But, in short the first day had its ups and downs.

Oh, but we hit up Blue Star for breakfast. I almost forgot about that. I sent the call out to `#hashiconf` on Twitter, but I guess no one wanted to join us. Or Twitter is a horrible coordination mechanism and the conference should have had a Slack.

Ultimately, the positive that I do not note at the above link is that I met up with a few people I met at Monitorama earlier this year. And that was awesome. I don't remember what was for dinner, maybe nothing. We went back to the hotel for far too long to await the after-hours activity because I guess Calvin was parties out. I don't remember if we went somewhere in between. Based on the direction from which we approached the venue, I think we did. But I don't remember what it was.

Oh, I remember. We went to Henry's on 12th for giant burgers.

Anyway, I was sad to learn that the event was across the river, but happy to learn that Hashicorp was providing shuttles. It was a pretty swanky place. Super-crowded until the staff let us in on the secret of the back room. So we just chilled and talked computers.

I challenged Calvin to a drinking contest. He declined.

### Tuesday

The second and final day of Hashiconf. Talks were, on the whole, better. We did Mother's for breakfast, which is always a pleasure. A "nah, I think I'll skip lunch today" kind of pleasure.

After the talks there was a happy hour that I didn't attend because fuck the establishment. Later that night a few of us hit up Deschute's and the Whiskey Library. Some solid scotch choices by Calvin.

I'm pretty sure that was it for the day.

### Wednesday

Was the adventure day. And poor Calvin missed half of it.

We did Cheryl's for breakfast. Calvin had an appropriate amount of food. We had some time before he had to be at the airport, so we took him on a field trip to the Zoo.

Calvin and Jeremy got kicked off the train on the way there for not having tickets. I pretended I didn't know them and scoffed at the "tourists" to everyone around me after the train departed again.

After I had been sufficiently ear-bled by screeching children in enclosed spaces, it was time for Calvin to leave so we all did.

After leaving Calvin on the train...something? We walked to the Rose Garden, I know that. I forget if there was anything else first. Probably not.

I guess that's where everything started becoming retroactively hazy.

We hit up Mike, one of the guys I knew from Monitorama and asked if he wanted to partake in an Escape Game. And he did. So we grabbed dinner at Casa de Matador - several margaritas and enchiladas. Lovely food in a lovely part of town. It required basically walking all the way back to the Rose Garden, though.

Then we tried to hit up Ground Kontrol, but I guess it was Free Play night, so it was packed. We went around the corner to Davis Street Tavern instead for a couple more cocktails before it was our appointment to escape the room.

So we hung out for a little bit and Ubered over to a sketchy neighborhood to get locked in a room. Like, the place didn't even have a sign on it, from what I remember. Mike just knocked on the door. We successfully escaped what I'm pretty sure was a game.

Then we headed back across the river to Salt and Straw for some delicious ice cream. Jeremy finally got that waffle cone he had been talking about. We decided to give Ground Kontrol another shot. We got in and it was indeed Free Play night. And things may have gotten a little out of control...kontrol? I'll leave the specifics as an exercise to any reader who wishes to ask Jeremy for embarassaing stories about me. But Portland makes some good IPAs.

### Thursday

Jeremy's last day.

We did breakfast at Cheryl's again. Then he bought a belt and had to head to the airport.

I went back to my room for a quick nap, which turned out to be a mistake. I woke up with the aggregate hangover of the previous 4 days, so I stayed in bed for the rest of the day.

### Friday

A brand new, hangoverless day.

Not a whole lot of craziness to report. I hit Brunch Box for a late breakfast. Well I guess I got a burger and not one of their breakfast sandwiches, so it falls neatly under 'lunch'. Then I took a walk. I hit the Waterfront for a couple hours to get some fresh air.

Went to 2nd Ave records and managed to refrain from buying anything, since my bag was already full enough that nothing so fragile as a record would be able to survive.

Hit up Powells so I'd have something to do during my many-days train adventure, especially given the lack of WiFi and spotty cell reception I've experienced so far.

Then I just kinda bummed around the city a bit until it was time to check out The Martian that night. Which was a very good movie. Preferable to the book, IMO.

### Saturday

Art museum in the early afternoon. Always a good time.

Laundry at the Spin Laundry Lounge (i.e. laundomat+bar). Pretty neat place. Free soap and the machines were like super-high-power so it maybe took all of an hour.

Then I just went out and experienced Saturday night in downtown Portland. Hit up a couple bars, but mostly just walked around witnessing little vignettes of other peoples' nights:

* The dude who asked "What's the matter? Never seen a homeless guy before?" to another guy who was himself homeless.
* The women loudly fighting over which bar to go to after Deschute's.
* The guy passed out in the doorway of a closed shop spooning his bicycle.
    * The cop who just walked passed him, shaking his head.
* Then I swung back around to Powell's because what else does one do on a Saturday night in the city?

### Sunday

Finally made it up to the Arboretum. Got lost for three hours or so. It was a really nice place and not very crowded. I really need to start remembering to bring a hat when I go to Portland.

Then I got ahold of Mike and we went to Montage. A creepy-looking place under a bridge that is actually surprisingly-nice inside. Steak and cocktails.

After that we did a spot of walking down the Waterfront again, this time south instead of north. Turns out there's a little resortish place with Segway tours and all that stuff to the south instead of the homeless camps to the north. A nice change of pace.

Then I called it an early night because I needed to ramp up for 5 days on a train.

### And Now

I'm here on a train. It has been a couple of days since I typed the above. I am no longer in Sacramento - we just left Grand Junction, Colorado.
But I guess the trainventure should be a separate thing.
