I'm writing this on a train leaving Sacramento. I actually left Portland yesterday. I miss it.

One day, while eating lunch from a delicious food truck in a pigeon-infested park, I saw the following exchange.

GuyA is sitting on a ledge. Probably in his 50s, short hair, black t-shirt, large backpack.
GuyB walks up to a trash can. He might be in his early 20s, wearing typical skater clothing.
GuyB scrounges a meal from the trash can. Notices GuyA looking at him: "What's the matter, never seen a homeless guy before?"
GuyB keeps walking. GuyA stands up and scrounges his own meal from the trash can.

I know that is a little sad and a little weird, but that is Portland. A little sad and a little weird.

### Sunday

So I flew in on Sunday. Jeremy and Calvin flew in on Saturday, but as we all know parts of the world that I'm
not consciously observing cease to exist.

We did usual 'first day in Portland' stuff. We hit up The Grotto for a quick jaunt. That was something
I hadn't done before, so that was cool. It's so close to the airport that it usually doesn't make sense
to do, but it was a nice enough place.

We did Kenny and Zuke's for lunch, as is tradition for me. Calvin accidentally got an insane sandwich.

We visited the tree museum and learned that Calvin is a better firefighter than Jeremy.

We tried for the zoo, but it was too late, so we walked around a bit before heading back downtown.

Then we Masu'd for dinner. Calvin got a giant miso ramen. I ordered steak, but they had run out,
so they went to Whole Foods just for me. I'm also pretty sure it was free? But I was vaguely sakied up
so I could be misremembering.

Then we headed to the park to check out the eclipse, which was neat. A bunch of other folks were
also hanging out for the same reason.

Then we hit up Deschute's on the way back to the hotel. Which is good because by that point I was
worried I wasn't going to get drunk at all that night. Calvin learned that he doesn't like West Coast
beer.

I also think we may have gotten ice cream at Ruby Scoops? Or was that another night?

### Monday

First day of Hashiconf. I'm not really going to talk much about Hashiconf proper because that's all
[over here](http://iwritethe.codes/hashiconf-2015-or-wheres-ryan-breen/) on my actual blog. But, in short
the first day had its ups and downs.

ETA: Oh, man, we hit up Blue Star for breakfast. I almost forgot about that. I sent the call out to `#hashiconf`
on Twitter, but I guess no one wanted to join us. Or Twitter is a horrible coordination mechanism (unless it's
the Arab Spring) and the conference should have had a Slack.

Ultimately, the positive that I do not note at the above link is that I met up with a few people I met at
Monitorama earlier this year. And that was awesome. I don't remember what was for dinner, maybe nothing.
We went back to the hotel for far too long to await the after-hours activity. I don't remember if we went
somewhere in between. Based on the direction from which we approached the venue, I think we did. But I don't
remember what it was.

Anyway, I was sad to learn that the even was across the river, but happy to learn that Hashicorp was providing
shuttles. It was a pretty swanky place. Super crowded until the staff let us in on the secret of the back room.
So we just chilled and talked computers.

Not really much else to say there, I think.

### Tuesday

The second and final day of Hashiconf. Talks were, on the whole, better. We did Mother's for breakfast, which
is always a pleasure. A "nah, I think I'll skip lunch today" kind of pleasure.

After the talks there was a happy hour that I didn't attend because fuck the establishment.

Later that night a few of us hit up Deschute's and the Whiskey Library. Some solid scotch choices by Calvin.

I'm pretty sure that was it for the day.

### Wednesday

Was the adventure day. And poor Calvin missed half of it.

We did Cheryl's for breakfast. Calvin had an appropriate amount of food. We had some time before he had to be
at the airport, so we took him on a field trip to the Zoo.

Calvin and Jeremy got kicked off the train on the way there for not having tickets. I pretended I didn't know
them and scoffed at the "tourists" to everyone around me after the train departed again.

After I had been sufficently ear-bled by screeching children in enclosed spaces, it was time for Calvin to leave
so we all did.

After leaving Calvin on the train....something? We walked to the Rose Garden, I know that. I forget if there
was anything else first. Probably not.

I guess that's where everything started becoming retroactively hazy.

We hit up Mike, one of the guys I knew from Monitorama and asked if he wanted to partake in an Escape Game.
And he did.

So we grabbed dinner at Casa de Matador - several margaritas and enchiladas.

Then we tried to hit up Ground Kontrol, but I guess it was Free Play night, so it was packed. We
went around the corner to Davis Street Tavern instead of a couple more cocktails.

After that we Ubered over to a sketchy neighborhood to get locked in a room. We successfully escaped.

Then we headed back across the river to Salt and Straw for some delicious ice cream and gave Ground Kontrol
another shot. We got in and it was indeed Free Play night. And things may have gotten a little out of
control...kontrol? I'll leave the specifics as an exercise to anyone who wishes to ask Jeremy for embarassaing
stories about me.

### Thursday

Jeremy's last day.

We did breakfast at Cheryl's again. Then he bought a belt and had to head to the airport.

I went back to my room for a quick nap, which turned out to be a mistake. I woke up with the aggregate
hangover of the previous 4 days, so I stayed in bed for the rest of the day.

### Friday

A brand new, hangoverless day.

Not a whole lot of craziness to report. I hit Brunch Box for a late breakfast and took a walk.
I hit the Waterfront for a couple hours to get some fresh air.

Went to 2nd Ave records and managed to refrain from buying anything, since my bag was already full enough
that nothing so fragile as a record would be able to survive.

Hit up Powells so I'd have something to do during my many-days train adventure, especially given the lack of WiFi
and spotty cell reception.

Then I just kinda bummed around the city a bit until it was time to check out The Martian that night. Which was a
very good movie. Preferable to the book, IMO.

### Saturday

Art museum in the early afternoon. Always a good time.

Laundry at the Spin Laundry Lounge (i.e. laundomat+bar). Pretty neat place.

Then I just went out and experienced Saturday night in downtown Portland. Hit up a couple bars, but mostly just
walked around witnessing little vignettes of other peoples' nights.

The dude with the guitar who offered to play a song for a dollar (but I had no dollar to give). When
I said I was sorry I had no dollar, he told me to be silly instead of being sorry.

The women loudly fighting over which bar to go to after Deschute's.

The guy passed out in the doorway of a closed shop spooning his bicycle.

Then I swung back around to Powell's because what else does one do on Saturday nights.

### Sunday

Finally made it up to the Arboretum. Got lost for a few hours.

I really need to start remembering to bring a hat when I go to Portland.

Then I got ahold of Mike and we went to....Montage? A creepy-looking place under a bridge that is actually
surprisingly-nice inside.

After that we did a spot of walking down the Waterfront again, this time south instead of north.
Turns out there's a little resortish place with Segway tours and all that stuff to the south
instead of the homeless camps to the north. A nice change of pace.

Then I called it an early night because I needed to ramp up for 5 days on a train.
