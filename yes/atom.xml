    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h4 id="Next_week_starts_my_6_weeks_off-">Next week starts my 6 weeks off.</h4><p>So that’s cool. I mean, it’s not completely unheard of - especially in the tech space. But it’s unheard of for me to have more than a week with nothing to do. At least for the past 10 years or so. So I’m pretty excited.</p>
<h4 id="Not_really_nothing-">Not really nothing.</h4><p>“Nothing” to do might be a strong word. I’ve got a lot to do.</p>
<h4 id="Anyway-">Anyway.</h4><p>I wanted to try out <a href="http://hexo.io" target="_blank" rel="external">hexo</a> for a blog engine, so I figured I’d try it here and pretend I’m going to write about what’s going on during my vistabreak, especially during my 5 day train trip across the country.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if that’s going to happen, but this is a good evaluation of hexo. I kind of want to migrate my actual blog to this away from ghost. I tried other static site generators like jekyll before, but I didn’t care for them. But this is nice. Maybe I just know how to computer better these days.</p>]]></content>
